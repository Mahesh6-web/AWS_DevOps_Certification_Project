CI/CD Pipeline for PHP Application using Jenkins, Docker & Ansible

This project implements a complete Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using:

GitHub – Version control

Jenkins – CI/CD automation

Jenkins Slave Node – Build server & test server

Docker – Containerizing the PHP application

Ansible – Configuration management & automated deployment

The goal is to automatically deploy a PHP web application to a test server whenever new code is pushed to the GitHub repository.
